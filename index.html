			<h1>Identifying The Problem</h1>
			<h2>Monosodium Glutamate Or msg for short in food. MSG is a popular food additive that has been deemed to be
				unhealthy and dangerous for your health. It has gained a bad reputation to the point where there are even
				petitions to remove the ingredient in everyday food. Adding on, certain restaurants would even advertise their
				food as MSG free in order to attract customers who look to eat healthier. MSG is used to add flavor to a dish.
				There has also been cases where people have stated that MSG is causing obesity and high blood pressure.</h2>

			<h1>What is MSG? Is it bad for you?</h1>
			<h2>MSG also knows as Monosodium glutamate has always had a bad reputation in the media, just like anything that's
				rendy. Not this bring up the question. Is MSG actually bad for us? Most people across America choose to abide by
				scociety's negative view on MSG however they may have been worried for all these years for nothing.</h2>

	<div class="PageFive text-center" id="P5">
		<div class="col-md-8">
			<h1>Stats on MSG</h1>
			<h2>As previously said, many Americans have been worried for years but Im here to share the facts with you.
				According to Rachel Feltman from the Washington Post, She has something to say that defies peoples opinion on
				MSG. Feltman says, " Natural glutamate occurs in many foods, and is used as an additive in tons of "MSG-free"
				products.". If people claim to be allergic to MSG or say tht they never consume it because it's terrible for
				you, they're lying to themselves. We consume MSG particles without knowledge most of the time and it hasn't
				harmed us yet, so people shouldn't be afraid to have it in their foods any longer; Any fears that people have
				had about MSG can be put to rest! </h2>

	<div class="PageSix text-center" id="P6">
		<div class="col-md-8">
			<h1>Media on MSG</h1>
			<h2>A big reason as to why MSG is seen by Americans as harmful is because of the bad repuation the media gives it.
				All over social media, there is a flood of "Health influencers" that do not do proper research on their facts;
				Many times one account will contradict another. The best way to truly gain information on the subject is to do
				proper research on said subject and use a reliable source. People do a very good job at making their lies sound
				like fatcs when they actually have never done their own research; they'll go based off of what they hear others
				say. I'm here to contradict all of them with real facts to properly inform all the people. </h2>

	<div class="PageSeven text-center" id="P7">
		<div class="col-md-8">
			<h1>David Chang</h1>
			<h2>David Chang, a host on the hit show "Ugly Delicious" recently made a speech concerning the bad rap MSG has. He
				states that people do not truly know that affects of MSG. People usualy give themselves a placebo effect and
				worry that their feeling ill if they consume MSG, but is it all psychological. Chang also stated while eating
				MSG can cause some ill feeling, it is not a direct cause of the MSG but rather the persons tolerance to it. Just
				like spicy food, People can react to the additive in many diffrent ways. It does not mean that one is allergic,
				but has a lower tolerance for it and should just eat less.</h2>

		<div class="col-md-8">
			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<h2> Concluding for all of you reading this, you no longer have to fear MSG! Put away those fake media tabs that
				are saying this is bad for you and it will kill you and start to open up yout taste buds again. With the
				evidence I have shown you, it is all in your head and you shouldn't fear this product. It is already in many
				food we eat today without our knowledge, so why not knowingly try this flavorable spice. As well, David Chang
				tries all types of foods that may be bad for you, but he has tried it and proved that there's no need to worry.
				If you don't believe me, take a look yourself! You never know what you might find. </h2>

# Conclusion

Concluding for all of you reading this, you no longer have to fear MSG! Put away those fake media tabs that are saying this is bad for you and it will kill you and start to open up yout taste buds again. With the evidence I have shown you, it is all in your head and you shouldn't fear this product.

It is already in many food we eat today without our knowledge, so why not knowingly try this flavorable spice. As well, David Chang tries all types of foods that may be bad for you, but he has tried it and proved that there's no need to worry.

If you don't believe me, take a look yourself! You never know what you might find.

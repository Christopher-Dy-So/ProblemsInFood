# Media on MSG

A big reason as to why MSG is seen by Americans as harmful is because of the bad repuation the media gives it.

All over social media, there is a flood of "Health influencers" that do not do proper research on their facts; Many times one account will contradict another.

The best way to truly gain information on the subject is to do proper research on said subject and use a reliable source. People do a very good job at making their lies sound like fatcs when they actually have never done their own research; they'll go based off of what they hear others say.

I'm here to contradict all of them with real facts to properly inform all the people.

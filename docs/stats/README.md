# Stats on MSG

As previously said, many Americans have been worried for years but Im here to share the facts with you. According to Rachel Feltman from the Washington Post, She has something to say that defies peoples opinion on MSG. Feltman says, " Natural glutamate occurs in many foods, and is used as an additive in tons of "MSG-free" products.". If people claim to be allergic to MSG or say tht they never consume it because it's terrible for you, they're lying to themselves. We consume MSG particles without knowledge most of the time and it hasn't harmed us yet,so people shouldn't be afraid to have it in their foods any longer; Any fears that people have had about MSG can be put to rest!

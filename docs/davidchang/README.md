# David Chang

David Chang, a host on the hit show "Ugly Delicious" recently made a speech concerning the bad rap MSG has.

He states that people do not truly know that affects of MSG. People usualy give themselves a placebo effect and worry that their feeling ill if they consume MSG, but is it all psychological.

Chang also stated while eating MSG can cause some ill feeling, it is not a direct cause of the MSG but rather the persons tolerance to it. 

Just like spicy food, People can react to the additive in many different ways.

It does not mean that one is allergic, but has a lower tolerance for it and should just eat less.

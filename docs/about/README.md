## For my first year writing class, I was given the task to find one issues in food and write a blog

Food plays a part in everyday life, whether it is fine dining or just a simple meal it is the subject for survival.

For my first year writing class, I was given the task to find one issues in food and write a blog about it.

In this blog I will identify and research the problem, from there I will make a series of posts using the information I have to address the issues at hand.
